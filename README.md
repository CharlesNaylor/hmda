# HMDA Data Analysis

 

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires mortgage lenders in the United States to disclose information about the mortgage lending decisions they have made. Specifically, it requires that each lender report on all of the official mortgage applications they have received and whether or not the application was accepted or denied. This dataset provides a rich problem for data analysis and data science and is publicly available through their API. We would like you to build a classifier that predicts from the disclosed attributes of the mortgage applications whether or not the application will be approved. We are less concerned about the final accuracy of the classifier and more about the process and framework you use to get there. Please prepare a brief presentation in which you walk us through your process, results, and discoveries along the way. We hope to see the code used to explore and analyze the data. 

 

The HMDA dataset is large, feel free to select a specific cut of the data for model development, for example a specific geography or a specific type of mortgage. The dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/
